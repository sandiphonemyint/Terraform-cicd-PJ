# Globally Autoscaling Web Service on Google Cloud 

This Terraform project deploys a globally autoscaling web service on Google Cloud Platform, inspired by the movie *Interstellar*. It demonstrates concepts such as:

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** All resources are defined using Terraform, making deployments repeatable and predictable.
*   **Autoscaling:** Instance groups automatically scale based on CPU utilization to handle varying traffic loads.
*   **Global Load Balancing:** A global HTTP(S) load balancer distributes traffic across instances in multiple regions, providing high availability and low latency.
*   **Managed Instance Groups (MIGs):** Regional MIGs provide resilience and self-healing for the application instances.
*   **Cloud NAT:** Enables instances without public IP addresses to access the internet for package downloads and updates.
*   **Google Managed SSL Certificates:** Provides HTTPS encryption for secure communication.
*   **Cloud DNS:** Manages DNS records for the application.
*   **Interstellar Theme:** The web application and supporting resources are named and styled with an *Interstellar* theme.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

1.  **Instance Template:** Defines the configuration for the instances, including machine type, image, and startup script.
2.  **Managed Instance Groups (MIGs):** Two regional MIGs are created, one in `us-central1` and another in `eu-west2`, providing high availability and geographical distribution.
3.  **Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across the MIGs, ensuring low latency and resilience.
4.  **Cloud NAT:** Enables instances in both regions to access the internet for package downloads and updates, even though they don't have public IP addresses.
5.  **Cloud DNS:** A DNS record is created to point to the load balancer's IP address.
6.  **Google Managed SSL Certificate:** An SSL certificate is provisioned for the application's domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections.
7.  **Storage Bucket:** A Google Cloud Storage bucket stores the static files for the web application (`index.html`, `main.css`).
8.  **Firewall Rules:** Firewall rules allow HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and ICMP traffic to the instances. Also, allows all egress traffic.

## Prerequisites

*   **Google Cloud Project:** You need a Google Cloud project with billing enabled.
*   **Terraform:** Install Terraform on your local machine. ([https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli))
*   **gcloud CLI:** Install and configure the Google Cloud CLI. ([https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install))
*   **DNS Zone:** You need a managed DNS zone in Cloud DNS for your domain.

## Modules

The Terraform code is organized into modules for better maintainability and reusability:

*   **`instance_template`:** Creates an instance template.
*   **`mig`:** Creates a regional managed instance group.
*   **`firewall`:** Creates firewall rules.
*   **`load_balancer`:** Creates a global HTTP(S) load balancer, health check, backend service, URL map, target proxy, and forwarding rule.
*   **`storage_bucket`:** Creates a Google Cloud Storage bucket and uploads static website files.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SamPriyadarshi/real-world-devops-projects.git
    cd 1-global-web-application
    ```

2.  **Login to your Google Cloud account:**
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

3.  **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4.  **Create `terraform.tfvars`:**

    Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` and set the necessary variable values. For example:

    ```
    project_id              = "your-gcp-project-id"
    bucket_name             = "your-unique-bucket-name"
    dns_zone_name           = "your-dns-zone-name"
    dns_managed_zone_name = "your-dns-managed-zone-name"
    ```

5.  **Configure the Backend:**
    *   Update the `backend "gcs"` block in your `main.tf` file with the correct bucket name:

    ```terraform
    terraform {
      # ... other configuration ...
      backend "gcs" {
        bucket = "real-world-devops-state" # Replace with your bucket name
        prefix = "terraform/state"        # Optional prefix
      }
    }
    ```
    *   Run `terraform init` again to initialize the backend.

6.  **Deploy the infrastructure:**

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

7.  **Access the application:**

    Once the deployment is complete, you can access the application using the `forwarding_rule_ip_address` output or by using the DNS name you configured (e.g., `galactic-empire.google-cloud-pocs.dev`).

## Interstellar Theme

The web application displays a one-liner inspired by the movie *Interstellar*, along with the region from which the instance serving the request originated. The one-liner can be customized in the `files/index.html` file.

## Notes

*   The default firewall rules allow all egress traffic. In a production environment, it's highly recommended to restrict egress traffic to only necessary destinations.
*   The instance startup script installs Apache and configures it to serve the website from the GCS bucket.
*   The SSL certificate provisioning process might take some time.
*   Terraform state is stored remotely in a dedicated Google Cloud Storage bucket (`real-world-devops-state`) to enable collaboration and provide a more robust state management solution.
